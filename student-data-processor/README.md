### Objective A: Data Generation
📹 **[Objective A.mp4](./Objective%20A.mp4)** *(Click → View raw → Download)*

This video demonstrates the data generation functionality, including:
- Creating student data in Excel format
- Generating sample datasets
- Data structure and format validation
- **Fast performance**: 1 million records generated in seconds

### Objective B: Data Processing
📹 **[Objective B.mp4](./Objective%20B.mp4)** *(Click → View raw → Download)*

This video demonstrates the data processing functionality, including:
- Converting Excel files to CSV format
- Applying score adjustments (+10 points)
- Processing validation and results display
- **Fast performance**: Processing completed in seconds

> **💡 Note**: The Objective B video shows the existence of 2 files - one in Excel format and another in CSV format, indicating that both Objective A (data generation) and Objective B (data processing) worked successfully.
