### Objective A: Data Generation
ðŸ“¹ **[Objective A.mp4](./Objective%20A.mp4)** *(Click â†’ View raw â†’ Download)*

This video demonstrates the data generation functionality, including:
- Creating student data in Excel format
- Generating sample datasets
- Data structure and format validation
- **Fast performance**: 1 million records generated in seconds

### Objective B: Data Processing
ðŸ“¹ **[Objective B.mp4](./Objective%20B.mp4)** *(Click â†’ View raw â†’ Download)*

This video demonstrates the data processing functionality, including:
- Converting Excel files to CSV format
- Applying score adjustments (+10 points)
- Processing validation and results display

> **ðŸ’¡ Note**: The Objective B video shows the existence of 2 files - one in Excel format and another in CSV format, indicating that both Objective A (data generation) and Objective B (data processing) worked successfully.
