### Objective A: Data Generation
📹 **[Objective A.mp4](./Objective%20A.mp4)** *(Click → View raw → Download)*

This video demonstrates the data generation functionality, including:
- Creating student data in Excel format
- Generating sample datasets
- Data structure and format validation
- **Fast performance**: 1 million records generated in seconds

### Objective B: Data Processing
📹 **[Objective B.mp4](./Objective%20B.mp4)** *(Click → View raw → Download)*

This video demonstrates the data processing functionality, including:
- Converting Excel files to CSV format
- Applying score adjustments (+10 points)
- Processing validation and results display
- **Fast performance**: Processing completed in seconds

> **💡 Note**: The Objective B video shows the existence of 2 files - one in Excel format and another in CSV format, indicating that both Objective A (data generation) and Objective B (data processing) worked successfully.

## Sample Files
📁 **Demonstration outputs:**

**Available for download:**
- 📄 **[test_excel.xlsx](./test_excel.xlsx)** - Sample Excel file

**Generated during demonstration (shown in videos):**
- `student_data_20250820_234320_1000000_records.xlsx` - Excel file with 1 million records (too large for GitHub)
- `temp_1755722830488_student_data_20250820_234320_1000000_records_processed_20250820_234710.csv` - Processed CSV file (too large for GitHub)

> 💡 **Note**: The large demonstration files exceed GitHub's file size limits but are visible in the videos. The sample Excel file above can be used to test the application.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Angular 18.0.0
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot 3.4.5
